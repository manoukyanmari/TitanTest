Hi dear Service Titan team. I am honored to finally do the task, as it was lost in my SPAM folder before.
Thanks for the opportunity after missing out because of the spam issue.

#### *This is my first full small project in Python.*

I have the runner (executer) file: **index.py**.
index.py runs the main implementation (service) which is: **data_extractor.py**.

#### I used some libs to help with *dates, csv export and os(to create a file automatically)*.


#### First I had to setup Python on my new Macos and had to go through the following links, part of my time went on these things:

- https://macpaw.com/how-to/install-pip-mac
- https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-debug-configuration.html#create-permanent
- https://mac.install.guide/python/pipx
- https://mac.install.guide/terminal/path
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47441949/error-running-git-in-pycharm-after-recent-update


### ***I tricked chatGPT as I had some issues with Data Types, just for reducing the time frame, as I have only 2 hours, here is the link:***
